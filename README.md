 I have worked at [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/) , a leading provider of information security and compliance cloud solutions. As a "Policy Compliance QA Engineer" my role was to make sure codes in "QualysGuard Policy Compliance tool"  could identify and audit all non-compliant security settings in various IT Systems.
